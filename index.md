### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

Lab 6, Part 2, was also a personal favorite of mine. Using doubles to store values which would then be used to find the averages helped me get a real-world idea of things we may have to create for companies that require these sorts of programs. Considering how much of life is math, it was nice to work with something that will truly come in handy later down the road in the life of someone like a data scientist.

    
*Lab 7

Lab 7, Part 2, was definitely one of my favorites as I love games of chance, and learning how to implement one of my favorite pastimes into a digital format was terrific. Writing code to correctly tell a hand's value was not an easy task, but definitely rewarding. Creating the max amount of arguments and watching it all operate correctly was very satisfying as well, and I am looking forward to doing this with more projects.

*Lab 8

Prime Numbers are often talked about in elementary to college-level mathematics. In Lab 8, Part 2, we furthered this talk of prime numbers by creating a program that checks to see if a number is a prime number. This lab furthered our knowledge of for loops, as well as how to convert real-world scenarios like programming a prime number checking tool into reality. Its also nice to see the background behind many of the math tools we use in our current age to verify our math work.
